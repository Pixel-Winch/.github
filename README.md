Speed up painting and design with Coolorus: a dockable Mac color wheel featuring gamut masks, complementary/triad/tetrad chords, temperature/value rails, and swatch/history rings. Extract palettes from images, lock brand/show palettes, and copy HEX/RGB/HSB quickly. ColorSync support keeps sRGB/P3 accurate.
