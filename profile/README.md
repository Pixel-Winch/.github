## üß† Why Colorists Choose Coolorus
- **Speed:** Pick hues & values without hunting palettes; one gesture = hue, saturation, brightness, and temperature.  
- **Discipline:** Lock to **gamuts** and **harmony rules** so explorations stay on-brand and print-safe.  
- **Memory:** Swatch rings, history, and chord presets keep a session‚Äôs palette coherent across dozens of layers.  
- **Focus:** Minimal, high-contrast UI that docks cleanly‚Äîless panel juggling, more painting/designing.

## üß≠ Overview (Expanded)

**Coolorus for Mac** is a **professional color wheel** and palette system designed for illustrators, concept artists, matte painters, UI designers, and anyone who lives inside pixel editors. Instead of the flat, tiny color pickers bundled with many apps, Coolorus gives you a **large, responsive HSB wheel** with **gamut masks**, **harmony chords**, **temperature sliders**, **value ramps**, **swatch rings**, and **history pebbles**‚Äîall in one compact, dockable panel. You move through color space **deliberately**: constrain hue to a film palette, explore triads/tetrads without math, push saturation while compensating value, or snap to a brand‚Äôs restricted gamut so exported assets stay consistent across screens and print.

The wheel is more than a picker; it‚Äôs a **thinking tool**. Gamut masks fence your exploration, so you can sketch freely without drifting into out-of-scope hues. Harmony engines (complementary, split, triad, tetrad, analogous, custom chords) act like **training wheels for taste**‚Äîgreat for quick ideation or when you need to vary accents without wrecking the base palette. Saturation/value interaction is tuned to feel natural for brushwork: push chroma into light with guards that prevent chalkiness, keep shadows rich with perceptual compensation, and quickly dial **neutral ramps** for UI states and typography tints.

Production workflows benefit from **sticky palettes** that live with the document: load a palette from an image, lock a show palette for a sequence, pin brand colors as **protected swatches**, and roll subtle variations with jitter that respects your masks. Keyboard/mouse gestures drive the wheel fast (drag for hue, inner drag for saturation/value, modifier for fine scrubs). All controls are **color-managed** through macOS, so on wide-gamut displays (P3) you‚Äôre seeing what your file actually holds‚Äîno more guessing.

The result is a panel that reduces **decision fatigue**. You spend less time fiddling with sliders and more time painting forms, designing interfaces, or exploring looks that stay **coherent, printable, and repeatable**‚Äîproject after project.

## üé® Artist Workflows

- **Concept/Illustration:** Block in with a constrained **analogous** band, pop accents via **complementaries**, and roll value ramps for read.  
- **UI/Brand:** Load a **brand palette**, lock gamut, derive neutral states (hover/disabled) with perceptual value steps; export swatches.  
- **Matte/Lookdev:** Pull palette from a plate/reference, fence exploration to that world, and keep atmospherics consistent with temperature rails.  
- **Education:** Teach harmony by showing live chord relationships as you move the base hue.

---

## üìê Color Reasoning (Crash Course)

- **Gamut masks** make ‚Äúon-brand by default‚Äù the easy path. Instead of fixing off-palette picks later, you never make them.  
- **Harmony chords** create **structured contrast**‚Äîseparation without noise. Rotate the base and the family follows.  
- **Perceptual value rails** counter the classic ‚Äúsaturated highlights, muddy shadows‚Äù trap by compensating as you move.

---

## ‚ö° Shortcuts & Power Moves

- **Drag** on the wheel for hue, **inner drag** for SV.  
- **Shift** = fine adjustments; **Option/Alt** = temporary alternate mode.  
- **Number keys** map to saved **swatch ring** slots; **X** to swap FG/BG.  
- **Cmd-click** a history pebble to replace the closest ring swatch.  
- **Right-click** the wheel to flip chord types on the fly.

---

## üîå Compatibility & Integration

- Designed to dock alongside pro apps on macOS.  
- Color values copy/paste in **HEX / RGB / HSB** quickly to any toolchain.  
- ColorSync-aware for **sRGB / Display P3** UI work.  
- Works great on pen displays & tablets (large hit targets, gesture-first).
